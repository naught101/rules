<h1>Card Types<a class="headerlink" href="#card-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>WTactics provides the players with different card types that have their
own associated rules:</p>
<div class="section" id="creatures">
<h2>Creatures<a class="headerlink" href="#creatures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Creatures are the backbone of every army, they are the courageous forces
that will bring a player glorious victory (or a miserable defeat that is
best forgotten).</p>
<p>During the <em>Entrance</em> phase a player may put new creatures into play by
meeting their loyalty requirement, paying their gold cost and then
placing them into one of the two regions - the offensive or the
defensive. Creatures that are part of the offensive can attack the
opponent, but not defend against oppositional forces. Creatures that are
part of the defensive can defend against the opponent&#8217;s creatures, but
not be a part of the attacks launched against them.</p>
<p>Unlike other cards, creatures have specific and distinct values that
show their <em>fighting skills</em> in combat:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Attack (ATK): The skills a creature has in combat. This is the number
of damage the creature will inflict on it&#8217;s enemies if they should
stand in the creatures way.</li>
<li>Defense (DEF): How much damage a creature can take before it becomes
wounded and dies.</li>
</ul>
<p>When other cards <em>manipulate</em> these combat values they are often paired
and written in the form of x/y, where x is ATK and y is DEF.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Example: +5/-2 would mean that a creature would gain 5 more to it&#8217;s
ATK and lose 2 of it&#8217;s DEF.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="creature-types">
<h3>Creature Types<a class="headerlink" href="#creature-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All creatures also belong to one or more creature type. Creature types
are words separated by spaces in the creatures <em>name</em> and <em>subtype</em>
line. An example of a a couple of creature types a creature could have
is: <em>Leader Beast Caster</em>. Leader would be one, Beast another type, and
Caster a third creature type. They don&#8217;t necessarily relate to each
other in any way even if it may look like it in some cases.</p>
<p>Creature types have no function by themselves. They are however relevant
in many situations when other cards interact with the creature cards.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="movement">
<h3>Movement<a class="headerlink" href="#movement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A creature can be moved between the two fronts by it&#8217;s controller if:<ul>
<li>it is <em>unmarked</em> and</li>
<li>there hasn&#8217;t already occurred a movement in the other front where
the creature is not located.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To move a creature from one front to the other do the following:<ul>
<li>mark it</li>
<li>announce the move</li>
<li>place it in the other front.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A player may move any amount of creatures in this way.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="restrictions">
<h3>Restrictions<a class="headerlink" href="#restrictions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You may only move creatures before <em>or</em> after the attack phase - <em>not
both</em>. I.e. it&#8217;s not possible to move x, attack with y, and then move
z.</li>
<li>Reminder: You may only move creatures in <em>one</em> of the fronts during
each turn. You may <em>not</em> move creatures in both fronts during the
same turn.<ul>
<li>Example: You <em>can&#8217;t</em> move x from the Offensive into the Defensive,
and then move z from the Defensive into the Offensive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="life-death">
<h3>Life &amp; Death<a class="headerlink" href="#life-death" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If all damage has been resolved in a battle and the result is that a
creatures defence (DEF) was equal to or smaller than the attacking
creatures attack (ATK) then the creature dies.</li>
<li>Creatures that die are placed in the Grave. Any and all cards
attached to it go to their owners grave.<ul>
<li>Exceptions to this is the Equipment pickup rule, discussed in a
separate paragraph further down in this text.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are several cards and creature abilities that can affect the
outcome of battle by manipulating what happens.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="equipment">
<h2>Equipment<a class="headerlink" href="#equipment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Cards with the <em>Equipment</em> cardtype are considered to be <em>Equipment</em>.</li>
<li>A creature can carry an unlimited amount of Equipment but may only
<em>use</em> the effects of <em>one</em> Equipment card from each Equipment subtype
at the same time: Equipment effects only stack if the Equipment cards
either <em>lack</em> subtypes or have <em>different</em> subtypes.<ul>
<li>Example: A creature has an &#8220;Equipment - Weapon&#8221; card called
&#8220;Damocle&#8217;s Sword&#8221;. The sword gives the creature +5/0. Giving the
creature an additional &#8220;Equipment - Weapon&#8221; card will <em>not</em> add
<em>any</em> of it&#8217;s effects while Damocle&#8217;s Sword is being used since
both cards share an Equipment subtype.</li>
<li>If a Creature is attacking and has multiple Equipment cards with
the same subtypes the creature&#8217;s controller should clearly state
which Equipment the creature will use during that <em>turn</em>. This
must be announced when the creature is declared to be an attacker,
before the defender&#8217;s are appointed by the opposing player. When
the creature is a defender instead the announcement of what
equipment is used does not have to be made until <em>after</em> the
creature has blocked an attacker.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When equipment is put into play it is given, <em>attached</em>, to a
specific creature. That creatures is from then and thereafter an
<em>Equipped</em> creature. A creature is <em>unequipped</em> if has no equipment
cards attached to it.<ul>
<li>Equipment stays attached to an equipped creature and follows it
wherever it&#8217;s carrier is going. This includes, but is not limited
to: Another front, the graveyard if sent there by some other
effect than combat, and back up to hand. The equipment stays on
the creature until a) the equipment it&#8217;s somehow removed by an
effect or b) the creature dies.<ul>
<li>Equipment that came back into a players hand by following the
creature that carried there becomes, when it reaches the hand,
<em>unattached</em> from that creature. The equipment is then
considered to be like any other card in hand, and has to be
paid for and attached to a creature again in order for it to
come into play once more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="reassign-equipment">
<h3>Reassign Equipment<a class="headerlink" href="#reassign-equipment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An equipped creature may, during it&#8217;s controllers own play phase, give
one target equipment it is carrying to another target local creature. To
be able to perform that action the giving creature as well as the
receiving creature must both be unmarked and unassigned. The player pays
the cost for the equipment once again, takes the equipment card from the
giver and places it on the target local receiver, and then marks both
the giver and receiver.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="drop-take-equipment">
<h3>Drop &amp; Take equipment<a class="headerlink" href="#drop-take-equipment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>When a creature dies <em>while in combat</em> it drops all it&#8217;s equipment on
the ground: The creature is discarded and put into the graveyard
while the equipment is left on the table <em>unattached</em> to any other
creature. All of it&#8217;s equipment cards are considered to be dropped on
the ground for the time being.</li>
<li>Equipment pick-ups allow each local allied unmarked creature under
the same players control to pick up <em>one</em> of the dropped Equipment
cards.</li>
<li>Any local creature may perform an <em>Equipment pick-up</em> during any
players <em>play phase</em> (while there are no ongoing attacks).</li>
<li>To perform the pick-up the player must announce that it is being
executed and <em>mark</em> the creature that does the picking-up. Once the
pick-up is performed, attach <em>one</em> of the Equipment cards the dead
creature was carrying to the creature that picked it up.</li>
<li>Notice that all effects and restrictions of a an equipment are still
in place even if a pick-up is attempted. Example: If a goblin tries
to pick-up equipment that explicitly states that it can&#8217;t be equiped
to any other creature type other than Human then the goblin will not
be able to make the pick-up.</li>
<li>A marked creature can&#8217;t pick up any Equipment since it can&#8217;t meet the
mark criteria.</li>
<li>A player can use any amount unmarked creatures to pick up dropped
equipment, but each creature may only pick-up&#8217;&#8217; one&#8217;&#8217; piece of
Equipment.</li>
<li>At the end of turn each player discards all dropped equipment that
wasn&#8217;t picked up.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="events">
<h2>Events<a class="headerlink" href="#events" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Events are cards representing one time effects. In CCG terminology
these are more widely known as <em>interrupts</em>, and in some CCG:s
they&#8217;re called <em>Instants</em>.</li>
<li>You may play an Event card at&#8217;&#8217; any time&#8217;&#8216;, even on your opponents
turn as <em>a response</em> to what he/she has done.</li>
<li>After an event has been used it is always discarded, and that happens
<em>the same turn</em> it was played.</li>
<li>When you play an event, you follow the instruction provided by its
rules text, then you put it in your grave.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="magic">
<h2>Magic<a class="headerlink" href="#magic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Magic</em> can only be played during the player&#8217;s <em>own</em> turn, during the
play phase, and only in a front where the player has a <em>caster</em>
around.</li>
<li>Magical effects stack.</li>
<li>Once a magic card has been played it is discarded.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="enchantments">
<h2>Enchantments<a class="headerlink" href="#enchantments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Enchantments</em> are scrolls or magic based on reading from a book.
They can only be played during the player&#8217;s <em>own</em> play phase and only
in a front where he/she has at least one unassigned and unmarked
<em>creature</em> around.</li>
<li>Enchantments are always targeting <em>something</em> or <em>someone</em>,</li>
<li>are always <em>attached</em> to it&#8217;s target,</li>
<li>and are permanently in play on the table until some effect removes
them.</li>
<li>Enchantments that don&#8217;t share a name stack.<ul>
<li>Example: If a player casts two Enchantments that share a name and
they each give the target creature +1/+1 then only one of them
will benefit the creature.</li>
<li>Example: Same scenario as in the above example, but in this case
the opponent removes one of the enchantments. There is then still
one Enchtantment left on the creature, and in contrast to earlier,
it now becomes activated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="quests">
<h2>Quests<a class="headerlink" href="#quests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Quests are mission that usually both the players have a chance of
performing or get into a conflict about. Quests have specific criteria
for when they are considered to be achieved or not. Whoever manages to
complete the tasks at hand gets the Quest&#8217;s Victory Points-value. In
addition, some Quests also give other rewards.</p>
<div class="section" id="prep-veto">
<h3>Prep &amp; Veto<a class="headerlink" href="#prep-veto" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The players both bring a Quest-deck of 10 cards each.</li>
<li>There may only be 1 copy of each Quest in a Quest Deck.</li>
<li>Before the game starts, players swap their Quest-decks with each
other, and look at their content.</li>
<li>Players take then turns to choose which <em>one</em> of the other player’s
revealed Quests should be removed from the game. The picked card is
then <a class="reference external" href="#Removed_from_Game">removed</a>. Repeat this step 3 times, so
that there only remains 7 Quest Cards in each Q-Deck.</li>
<li>Players shuffle the opponents Quest Deck and then swap the
Quest-decks back with each other. Optional re-shuffling of the own
Quest Deck is allowed at that point.</li>
<li>Quest Decks are placed face down in the centre of the table, next to
each other and in between the players.</li>
<li>Reveal the top card of each Quest Deck and put it back on the top of
it&#8217;s Quest Deck. face up. These two Quests are in play when the game
starts.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="questing">
<h3>Questing<a class="headerlink" href="#questing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>During the game a player may choose to embark on an epic and adventurous
Quest, pursuing their various goals to gather Victory Points and become
the last one standing. Keep in mind though that Questing is an optional
way of winning the game - you don&#8217;t have to concentrate on Quests if you
would rather just crush your enemy in all out war. If you do, make sure
you sabotage the opponents Questing attempts, so he/she doesn&#8217;t beat you
to the throne!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="accepting-abandon">
<h2>Accepting &amp; Abandon<a class="headerlink" href="#accepting-abandon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Accepting a Quest doesn&#8217;t cost anything and usually has no special
pre-requisites that have to be met. If it has, it will say so
explicitly on the Quest card.</li>
<li>To start pursuing any of the the two offered Quests you need to place
your <em>activation</em> token on it any time during <em>your own play phase</em>.
As long as a Quest has your acceptance token on it it is <em>active</em> for
you.</li>
<li>You can&#8217;t have more than two active Quests simultaneously.</li>
<li>Usually any amount of players are allowed to accept the same
Quest(s): A Quest is never &#8220;occupied&#8221; or &#8220;reserved&#8221; to just one
specific player. If two opposing players are both part of one and the
same Quest they are trying to reach it&#8217;s objectives on their own, and
whoever succeeds first will accomplish the Quest and gain it&#8217;s
Victory Points while the other one will fail it.</li>
<li>Once you have accepted a Quest everything you do in your fronts and
game in general that counts towards it&#8217;s goals or that interact with
what is specified on the Quest card will take you one step closer to
finishing or sabotaging it. This entails that different creatures,
abilities and cards can be used during different turns to resolve the
Quest while it is ongoing.</li>
<li>You can choose to abandon a Quest at any time during <em>your own play
phase</em> by removing the acceptance token from the Quest. Carefully
read the Quest instructions before doing this, as it may sometimes
not be forgiving against somebody that runs away in such a cowardly
fashion!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="quest-types">
<h2>Quest types<a class="headerlink" href="#quest-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Every Quest card has one of the following three different
Quest-subtypes:</p>
<div class="section" id="assignment">
<h3>Assignment<a class="headerlink" href="#assignment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The most common type of Quests. An assignment can be accomplished by
anyone. Failure to accomplish it <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> penalize the player that
tried.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Example:&nbsp;</span></tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Healers&nbsp;Exam</span></tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Heal&nbsp;at&nbsp;least&nbsp;one&nbsp;target&nbsp;creature&nbsp;three&nbsp;turns&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;row.</span></tt></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contract">
<h3>Contract<a class="headerlink" href="#contract" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The contract type works almost like the assignments with a single but
important exception. Usually anyone can try to accomplish it&#8217;s
objectives. The difference is that you get penalized if you fail to
accomplish the contract. Often that would happen because the contract
<em>expires</em> or because an opponent also went for the same contract and
accomplished it&#8217;s objectives before you did. To accept a contract you
must pay it&#8217;s <em>Escrow cost</em> at the same time as you place acceptance
token on it. Don&#8217;t worry though - the escrow is given back to you if and
only if you complete the Quest, along with the VPs you earned for it.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Blood&nbsp;Vengeance&nbsp;</span></tt></div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Kill&nbsp;three&nbsp;enemy&nbsp;creatures&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;same&nbsp;faction.&nbsp;They&nbsp;must&nbsp;have&nbsp;a&nbsp;total&nbsp;cost&nbsp;of&nbsp;at&nbsp;least&nbsp;5&nbsp;gold.&nbsp;Do&nbsp;it&nbsp;without&nbsp;losing&nbsp;a&nbsp;creature&nbsp;of&nbsp;your&nbsp;own&nbsp;in-between&nbsp;the&nbsp;killings.&nbsp;</span></tt></div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="confrontation">
<h3>Confrontation<a class="headerlink" href="#confrontation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some Quests lack the finesse of intrigues and take the brutish but
familiar shape of the hard cold steel. <em>Confrontation</em> cards are the
bloodiest Quest sub-type around. They&#8217;re usually made up of powerful
creatures that have to be slain without any mercy.</p>
<p>While pursuing a Confrontation Quest the following applies:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You can target the Confrontation creature(s) <em>directly</em> from <em>any</em> of
your fronts, even the Defensive. While a creature is somehow engaged
in a Confrontation Quest it is, for all intents and purposes,
<em>considered</em> to be in the same zone/location - the Questing zone -
along with whatever they&#8217;re battling in the Confrontation.</li>
<li>Because of that all <em>abilities</em> of the cards that are participating
in the Quest are, <em>in addition</em> to their placement in the offenseve
or defensive, <em>also</em> considered to be in the Questing zone where they
share location with the Confrontation.<ul>
<li>Cards that have <em>local</em> effects apply in the Confrontations
Questing zone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-movable zone: The Questing zone can not be moved into or out
from.<ul>
<li>Confrontation Creatures are <em>not</em> in a players offensive or
defensive zone: They are always trapped in the Questing zone, from
where they can not move.</li>
<li>Your creatures can not move into the Questing zone. The zone is an
abstract creation that simulates encounters with the Confrontation
creatures, and not a physical location as the offensive/defensive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While in combat against a Confrontation Creature:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A randomly selected <em>opponent</em> has temporary control over it and is
free to use it&#8217;s special abilities if it has any.</li>
<li><em>Any player</em> may use the abilities of his/her own creatures to affect
the Confrontation Creture or your warriors that are battling against
it</li>
<li>Confrontation creatures have hitpoints that are tracked and lose one
HP every time they take damage, no matter how much damage that
happens to be. The HP is a separate variable for each player that
engages the Confrontation creature in combat.<ul>
<li>Example: Kim penetrates the Confrontation Creature&#8217;s DEF by doing
10 ATK on that creatures 5 DEF. The Confrontation Creature loses 1
HP due to that, and 1 HP is deducted from it&#8217;s printed total HP of
5. When Kim engages the Confrontation creature the next time, it
will have have 4 HP. During the next turn John attacks the
Confrontation Creature. Since it&#8217;s the first time he has done so
and the Confrontation Creature has separate HP for each player,
the Confrontation Creature has all of it&#8217;s 5 HP when John attacks
it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Confrontation Creatures can&#8217;t intiate regular attacks on a player or
be used by a player somehow to launch such an attack unless
explicitly written on the Confrontation Creature.</li>
<li>When aborting a Quest against a Confrontation Creature your opponent
<em>may</em> distribute damage equal to the ATK of the Confrontation
Creature among any of your creatures that have previousley interacted
with it by being on combat with it or using their abilities on it.</li>
<li>Confrontations can&#8217;t be <em>equipped</em> - you can still only Equip your
own creatures.</li>
<li>When you are the random opponent that gained control of the
Confrontation Creature you can&#8217;t mark it in order to use it as
payment: You&#8217;re still only able to mark your own creatures in the
offensive &amp; defensive as payment for other card effects.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="expiration">
<h2>Expiration<a class="headerlink" href="#expiration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Quests that have been around for <em>one full round</em> (both players had
their own turn) and that have not been activated by any player are
automatically removed from the game. There are two exceptions to this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Confrontations stay no matter how many rounds they haven’t been
activated in.</li>
<li>Only one Quest may be removed per round due to expiration, even if
both cards have expired. When this scenario arises the player with
the lowest amount of VP decides which one will be removed. If both
players have the same amount of VPs then the player with the lowest
Influence gets to decide. If that is also a tie between the players
please use a random event that will make the decision.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-quests">
<h2>New Quests<a class="headerlink" href="#new-quests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Quest Decks are normally covered by a face up Quest Card once the
game has begun. Whenever a Quest card has been removed form game, for
whatever reason, the Quest Deck beneath it will be revealed. All new
Quests come from one of the Quest Decks that are revealed in that way.</p>
<p>There are only two ways in which new Quests can be revealed to the
players:</p>
<p><strong>1. Quest Expiration</strong> When a Quest expires it is removed from the
game. As it is removed from it&#8217;s Quest deck the Quest deck is revealed.
Turn the top card on that Quest Deck face up. That Quest is now
available to the players.</p>
<p><strong>2. Quest Completion</strong> If you manage to complete a Quest you <em>must</em> do
the following in order to reveal a new Quest:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Take the top face down card from the now reveled Quest Deck into your
hand. View it and then decides if you want that Quest to be available
or not.<ul>
<li>If yes, put it face up at the top of the Quest Deck it was taken
from.</li>
<li>If no, the card is sent to the bottom of the same Quest Deck it
was taken from, and the top card of that same Quest Deck is turned
face up. That Quest is then available to the players.</li>
