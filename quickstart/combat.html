<p>Combat is a very important aspect of WTactics. It&#8217;s used to try to
destabilize the opponent by lowering his/her influence and also to
eliminate any of the opposing forces that are somehow a threat to you.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Only <em>unmarked</em> creatures may attack or defend,</li>
<li>The active player is the only one that can perform one or more
<em>attacks</em> during his/her Attack/Move-phase. When doing so he/she must
use some or all of his/her creatures in the Offensive.</li>
<li>In the same manner, the inactive player is the only one that can
<em>defend</em> against attacks during the opponents turn. When doing so
he/she must use some or all of his/her creatures in the Defensive.<ul>
<li>A creature is, depending on this, <em>either</em> an attacker <em>or</em>
defender while in combat. It is never designated as <em>both</em> while
in one and the same combat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there are several combats battled out during the same turn they
<em>do not</em> resolve simultaneously!<ul>
<li>Combat is resolved on a &#8220;per attacker basis&#8221;: Each attacker
(together with all it&#8217;s blockers) is part of <em>one</em> single and
specific combat.</li>
<li>The order of how a combat(s) are resolved <em>could</em> often matter and
affect the outcome of other combats or states in the game. Choose
wisely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="combat-sequence">
<h2>Combat sequence<a class="headerlink" href="#combat-sequence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>I.</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The attacking (active) player may choose to attack during a
Move/Attack phase using any number of creatures that are to his/her
disposal in the Offensive. Creatures assigned to attack are called
<em>attackers</em>.<ul>
<li>Please note the difference between an attacking <em>player</em> and
<em>attackers</em>: The former is a player that launched an attack, the
latter are all Creatures that are currently attacking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The player chooses and announces <em>all attackers</em> that will fight that
turn by <em>marking</em> them &amp; announcing them as <em>attackers</em>.</li>
<li>In cases where there are several attacking creatures the attacking
(active) player gets to choose which combat will resolve first.</li>
<li>Then the defending (passive) player decides which combat will resolve
next. The players keep alternating turns in this manner to decide
which combat is next until all combats have been resolved.</li>
<li>Once the attackers are announced, the passive player gets a <em>Response
phase</em>, that gives him/her the opportunity to play <em>one</em> Event card
or <em>one</em> Ability (but not both at the same time). The attacking
player then gets the same opportunity, and this process is repeated
until <em>both players make a pass</em> on the opportunity to play something
in the Response phase. When the players pass on the Response phase
the attack continues as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II.</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The defending player <em>may choose</em> to either:<ul>
<li>Defend against the attack(s) with creatures in his/her <em>Defensive</em>
front. All creatures assigned to defend are called <em>defenders</em>
during the current battle.</li>
<li>Allow the attacks to go on undefended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the player decides not to defend the attack with his/her own
defenders he/she loses influence that&#8217;s equal to the total amount of
damage dealt by the attackers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III.</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If the player decides to defend he/she:<ul>
<li>May assign any number of creatures as defenders to any number of
attackers.</li>
<li>Must clearly show which defender is assigned to which attacker.<ul>
<li>Every defender can only defend against <em>one</em> attacker.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV.</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Each individual combat takes place. In each the players take turns
with <em>Response phases</em>.</li>
<li>When both players pass instead of responding to the other player&#8217;s
actions the combat is resolved:<ul>
<li>Take into account all effects and then compare the values of the
Attackers ATK value with the Defenders DEF value.<ul>
<li>If it is higher then the Defender will die. If it is lower the
Defender will survive.</li>
<li>Regardless of the outcome the Defender successfully protects
the defending players Influence.</li>
<li>Regardless of the outcome the Defender always gets to strike
back at the Attacker: Compare the Defender&#8217;s ATK value with the
Attackers DEF value - if it is equal to or higher then the
Attacker will die.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When combat is over place all dead Creatures into the discard piles,
along with all Events that were used during the combat and also any
Enchantments that were attached to the Creatures.</li>
</ul>
