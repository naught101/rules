===================
Marking & Unmarking
===================

-  Creature and Resource cards in play are always in either a *marked*
   or an *unmarked* state. All other card types lack the ability to
   (un)mark.
-  Cards always come into play in their *unmarked* state unless it's
   clearly specified otherwise.
-  The *marked* state is normally used to show that the card has been
   exhausted/used somehow.

   -  Examples of when a card becomes marked: When a creature attacks,
      moves or uses an activated ability that requires it to mark.

-  An unmarked card is considered to not be exhausted.
-  A card can only be marked *once* per *round* unless an effect or rule
   unmarks it.
-  There is no limit on how many times a card can become marked or
   unmarked if it happens as a result of an effect.
-  During every new turn the player gets all of his/her marked cards
   unmarked during the players own unmark/unassign-phase.

Mark me
-------

|The *Mark Me* symbol| Different actions, abilities and rules require a
card to mark when the player wants to use it in a particular way.
Marking is not a *cost*, as gold is. It should rather be seen as a kind
of prerequisite, an action that needs to *happen* in order for an effect
to happen. Whenever the mark me symbol is shown (a horizontal rectangle
with a symbol within, ) it means that you have to *mark the card itself*
if that is a part of the pre-requisite for whatever you're trying to
accomplish.

**Hints:**

-  "Mark me" symbol is abbreviated as just **(M)** when being typed out
   as plain text.
-  In wiki you can input the Mark Me symbol inline in any text to create
   a 17x10 px symbol like this by writing **{{M}}**

Mark allies
-----------

|The mark allies symbol, here showing that 3 allies have to
mark.|\ Should the mark symbol contain a number inside it instead of the
symbol it means that you have to mark that amount of *other* local
creatures instead othe creature itself. The creature that has the Mark
Allies-prerequiste can not mark itself for that reason.

**Hints:**

-  "Mark me" symbol is abbreviated as *(MaX)* when being typed out as
   plain text, where X is the number of allies that are supposed to
   become marked.

   -  Example: (Ma3).

-  In wiki you can input the Mark Allies symbol inline in any text to
   create a 17x10 px symbol like this by writing **{{Ma\|2}}**. Replace
   the number two with any number between 1 to 7 to get the proper
   symbol.

   {{notice|Marking vs Marked|There's a huge distinction between ''marking'' a card (switching a card from it's unmarked state into it's marked state) and discussing a ''marked'' card, which is a card that is ''already'' in it's marked state). }}

   {{warning|Disclaimer|
   How a player (un)marks cards is not decided by the rules or us behind WTactics due to legal reasons. It's up to the players to agree on it. In many CCG:s cards are rotated 90 degrees so that they lay down horizontally Rotating a card in this way is supposedly a patented idea in the U.S.A. To not violate patent(s) that protects that amazing invention we ''do not'' with this text want to give the idea that we encourage anyone to use that system to mark/unmark cards, and we also don't take any legal responsibility for players doing so.
