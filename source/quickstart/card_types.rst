Card Types
==========

WTactics provides the players with different card types that have their
own associated rules:

Creatures
---------

Creatures are the backbone of every army, they are the courageous forces
that will bring a player glorious victory (or a miserable defeat that is
best forgotten).

During the *Entrance* phase a player may put new creatures into play by
meeting their loyalty requirement, paying their gold cost and then
placing them into one of the two regions - the offensive or the
defensive. Creatures that are part of the offensive can attack the
opponent, but not defend against oppositional forces. Creatures that are
part of the defensive can defend against the opponent's creatures, but
not be a part of the attacks launched against them.

Unlike other cards, creatures have specific and distinct values that
show their *fighting skills* in combat:

-  Attack (ATK): The skills a creature has in combat. This is the number
   of damage the creature will inflict on it's enemies if they should
   stand in the creatures way.
-  Defense (DEF): How much damage a creature can take before it becomes
   wounded and dies.

When other cards *manipulate* these combat values they are often paired
and written in the form of x/y, where x is ATK and y is DEF.

-  Example: +5/-2 would mean that a creature would gain 5 more to it's
   ATK and lose 2 of it's DEF.

Creature Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All creatures also belong to one or more creature type. Creature types
are words separated by spaces in the creatures *name* and *subtype*
line. An example of a a couple of creature types a creature could have
is: *Leader Beast Caster*. Leader would be one, Beast another type, and
Caster a third creature type. They don't necessarily relate to each
other in any way even if it may look like it in some cases.

Creature types have no function by themselves. They are however relevant
in many situations when other cards interact with the creature cards.

Movement
~~~~~~~~

-  A creature can be moved between the two fronts by it's controller if:

   -  it is *unmarked* and
   -  there hasn't already occurred a movement in the other front where
      the creature is not located.

-  To move a creature from one front to the other do the following:

   -  mark it
   -  announce the move
   -  place it in the other front.

-  A player may move any amount of creatures in this way.

Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  You may only move creatures before *or* after the attack phase - *not
   both*. I.e. it's not possible to move x, attack with y, and then move
   z.
-  Reminder: You may only move creatures in *one* of the fronts during
   each turn. You may *not* move creatures in both fronts during the
   same turn.

   -  Example: You *can't* move x from the Offensive into the Defensive,
      and then move z from the Defensive into the Offensive.

Life & Death
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  If all damage has been resolved in a battle and the result is that a
   creatures defence (DEF) was equal to or smaller than the attacking
   creatures attack (ATK) then the creature dies.
-  Creatures that die are placed in the Grave. Any and all cards
   attached to it go to their owners grave.

   -  Exceptions to this is the Equipment pickup rule, discussed in a
      separate paragraph further down in this text.

-  There are several cards and creature abilities that can affect the
   outcome of battle by manipulating what happens.

Equipment
---------

-  Cards with the *Equipment* cardtype are considered to be *Equipment*.
-  A creature can carry an unlimited amount of Equipment but may only
   *use* the effects of *one* Equipment card from each Equipment subtype
   at the same time: Equipment effects only stack if the Equipment cards
   either *lack* subtypes or have *different* subtypes.

   -  Example: A creature has an "Equipment - Weapon" card called
      "Damocle's Sword". The sword gives the creature +5/0. Giving the
      creature an additional "Equipment - Weapon" card will *not* add
      *any* of it's effects while Damocle's Sword is being used since
      both cards share an Equipment subtype.
   -  If a Creature is attacking and has multiple Equipment cards with
      the same subtypes the creature's controller should clearly state
      which Equipment the creature will use during that *turn*. This
      must be announced when the creature is declared to be an attacker,
      before the defender's are appointed by the opposing player. When
      the creature is a defender instead the announcement of what
      equipment is used does not have to be made until *after* the
      creature has blocked an attacker.

-  When equipment is put into play it is given, *attached*, to a
   specific creature. That creatures is from then and thereafter an
   *Equipped* creature. A creature is *unequipped* if has no equipment
   cards attached to it.

   -  Equipment stays attached to an equipped creature and follows it
      wherever it's carrier is going. This includes, but is not limited
      to: Another front, the graveyard if sent there by some other
      effect than combat, and back up to hand. The equipment stays on
      the creature until a) the equipment it's somehow removed by an
      effect or b) the creature dies.

      -  Equipment that came back into a players hand by following the
         creature that carried there becomes, when it reaches the hand,
         *unattached* from that creature. The equipment is then
         considered to be like any other card in hand, and has to be
         paid for and attached to a creature again in order for it to
         come into play once more.

Reassign Equipment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An equipped creature may, during it's controllers own play phase, give
one target equipment it is carrying to another target local creature. To
be able to perform that action the giving creature as well as the
receiving creature must both be unmarked and unassigned. The player pays
the cost for the equipment once again, takes the equipment card from the
giver and places it on the target local receiver, and then marks both
the giver and receiver.

Drop & Take equipment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  When a creature dies *while in combat* it drops all it's equipment on
   the ground: The creature is discarded and put into the graveyard
   while the equipment is left on the table *unattached* to any other
   creature. All of it's equipment cards are considered to be dropped on
   the ground for the time being.
-  Equipment pick-ups allow each local allied unmarked creature under
   the same players control to pick up *one* of the dropped Equipment
   cards.
-  Any local creature may perform an *Equipment pick-up* during any
   players *play phase* (while there are no ongoing attacks).
-  To perform the pick-up the player must announce that it is being
   executed and *mark* the creature that does the picking-up. Once the
   pick-up is performed, attach *one* of the Equipment cards the dead
   creature was carrying to the creature that picked it up.
-  Notice that all effects and restrictions of a an equipment are still
   in place even if a pick-up is attempted. Example: If a goblin tries
   to pick-up equipment that explicitly states that it can't be equiped
   to any other creature type other than Human then the goblin will not
   be able to make the pick-up.
-  A marked creature can't pick up any Equipment since it can't meet the
   mark criteria.
-  A player can use any amount unmarked creatures to pick up dropped
   equipment, but each creature may only pick-up'' one'' piece of
   Equipment.
-  At the end of turn each player discards all dropped equipment that
   wasn't picked up.

Events
------

-  Events are cards representing one time effects. In CCG terminology
   these are more widely known as *interrupts*, and in some CCG:s
   they're called *Instants*.
-  You may play an Event card at'' any time'', even on your opponents
   turn as *a response* to what he/she has done.
-  After an event has been used it is always discarded, and that happens
   *the same turn* it was played.
-  When you play an event, you follow the instruction provided by its
   rules text, then you put it in your grave.

Magic
-----

-  *Magic* can only be played during the player's *own* turn, during the
   play phase, and only in a front where the player has a *caster*
   around.
-  Magical effects stack.
-  Once a magic card has been played it is discarded.

Enchantments
------------

-  *Enchantments* are scrolls or magic based on reading from a book.
   They can only be played during the player's *own* play phase and only
   in a front where he/she has at least one unassigned and unmarked
   *creature* around.
-  Enchantments are always targeting *something* or *someone*,
-  are always *attached* to it's target,
-  and are permanently in play on the table until some effect removes
   them.
-  Enchantments that don't share a name stack.

   -  Example: If a player casts two Enchantments that share a name and
      they each give the target creature +1/+1 then only one of them
      will benefit the creature.
   -  Example: Same scenario as in the above example, but in this case
      the opponent removes one of the enchantments. There is then still
      one Enchtantment left on the creature, and in contrast to earlier,
      it now becomes activated.

Quests
------

Quests are mission that usually both the players have a chance of
performing or get into a conflict about. Quests have specific criteria
for when they are considered to be achieved or not. Whoever manages to
complete the tasks at hand gets the Quest's Victory Points-value. In
addition, some Quests also give other rewards.

Prep & Veto
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. The players both bring a Quest-deck of 10 cards each.
#. There may only be 1 copy of each Quest in a Quest Deck.
#. Before the game starts, players swap their Quest-decks with each
   other, and look at their content.
#. Players take then turns to choose which *one* of the other player’s
   revealed Quests should be removed from the game. The picked card is
   then `removed <#Removed_from_Game>`__. Repeat this step 3 times, so
   that there only remains 7 Quest Cards in each Q-Deck.
#. Players shuffle the opponents Quest Deck and then swap the
   Quest-decks back with each other. Optional re-shuffling of the own
   Quest Deck is allowed at that point.
#. Quest Decks are placed face down in the centre of the table, next to
   each other and in between the players.
#. Reveal the top card of each Quest Deck and put it back on the top of
   it's Quest Deck. face up. These two Quests are in play when the game
   starts.

Questing
~~~~~~~~

During the game a player may choose to embark on an epic and adventurous
Quest, pursuing their various goals to gather Victory Points and become
the last one standing. Keep in mind though that Questing is an optional
way of winning the game - you don't have to concentrate on Quests if you
would rather just crush your enemy in all out war. If you do, make sure
you sabotage the opponents Questing attempts, so he/she doesn't beat you
to the throne!

Accepting & Abandon
-------------------

-  Accepting a Quest doesn't cost anything and usually has no special
   pre-requisites that have to be met. If it has, it will say so
   explicitly on the Quest card.
-  To start pursuing any of the the two offered Quests you need to place
   your *activation* token on it any time during *your own play phase*.
   As long as a Quest has your acceptance token on it it is *active* for
   you.
-  You can't have more than two active Quests simultaneously.
-  Usually any amount of players are allowed to accept the same
   Quest(s): A Quest is never "occupied" or "reserved" to just one
   specific player. If two opposing players are both part of one and the
   same Quest they are trying to reach it's objectives on their own, and
   whoever succeeds first will accomplish the Quest and gain it's
   Victory Points while the other one will fail it.
-  Once you have accepted a Quest everything you do in your fronts and
   game in general that counts towards it's goals or that interact with
   what is specified on the Quest card will take you one step closer to
   finishing or sabotaging it. This entails that different creatures,
   abilities and cards can be used during different turns to resolve the
   Quest while it is ongoing.
-  You can choose to abandon a Quest at any time during *your own play
   phase* by removing the acceptance token from the Quest. Carefully
   read the Quest instructions before doing this, as it may sometimes
   not be forgiving against somebody that runs away in such a cowardly
   fashion!

Quest types
-----------

Every Quest card has one of the following three different
Quest-subtypes:

Assignment
~~~~~~~~~~

The most common type of Quests. An assignment can be accomplished by
anyone. Failure to accomplish it *doesn't* penalize the player that
tried.

| ``Example: ``
| ``Healers Exam``
| ``Heal at least one target creature three turns in a row.``

Contract
~~~~~~~~

The contract type works almost like the assignments with a single but
important exception. Usually anyone can try to accomplish it's
objectives. The difference is that you get penalized if you fail to
accomplish the contract. Often that would happen because the contract
*expires* or because an opponent also went for the same contract and
accomplished it's objectives before you did. To accept a contract you
must pay it's *Escrow cost* at the same time as you place acceptance
token on it. Don't worry though - the escrow is given back to you if and
only if you complete the Quest, along with the VPs you earned for it.

| ``Blood Vengeance ``
| ``Kill three enemy creatures of the same faction. They must have a total cost of at least 5 gold. Do it without losing a creature of your own in-between the killings. ``
| ``Duration: 3 turns. ``
| ``Reward: Place a +2/0 counter on the creature that performed the fifth kill. ``
| ``Escrow: Discard 1 card from hand face down.``

Confrontation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some Quests lack the finesse of intrigues and take the brutish but
familiar shape of the hard cold steel. *Confrontation* cards are the
bloodiest Quest sub-type around. They're usually made up of powerful
creatures that have to be slain without any mercy.

While pursuing a Confrontation Quest the following applies:

-  You can target the Confrontation creature(s) *directly* from *any* of
   your fronts, even the Defensive. While a creature is somehow engaged
   in a Confrontation Quest it is, for all intents and purposes,
   *considered* to be in the same zone/location - the Questing zone -
   along with whatever they're battling in the Confrontation.
-  Because of that all *abilities* of the cards that are participating
   in the Quest are, *in addition* to their placement in the offenseve
   or defensive, *also* considered to be in the Questing zone where they
   share location with the Confrontation.

   -  Cards that have *local* effects apply in the Confrontations
      Questing zone.

-  Non-movable zone: The Questing zone can not be moved into or out
   from.

   -  Confrontation Creatures are *not* in a players offensive or
      defensive zone: They are always trapped in the Questing zone, from
      where they can not move.
   -  Your creatures can not move into the Questing zone. The zone is an
      abstract creation that simulates encounters with the Confrontation
      creatures, and not a physical location as the offensive/defensive.

While in combat against a Confrontation Creature:

-  A randomly selected *opponent* has temporary control over it and is
   free to use it's special abilities if it has any.
-  *Any player* may use the abilities of his/her own creatures to affect
   the Confrontation Creture or your warriors that are battling against
   it
-  Confrontation creatures have hitpoints that are tracked and lose one
   HP every time they take damage, no matter how much damage that
   happens to be. The HP is a separate variable for each player that
   engages the Confrontation creature in combat.

   -  Example: Kim penetrates the Confrontation Creature's DEF by doing
      10 ATK on that creatures 5 DEF. The Confrontation Creature loses 1
      HP due to that, and 1 HP is deducted from it's printed total HP of
      5. When Kim engages the Confrontation creature the next time, it
      will have have 4 HP. During the next turn John attacks the
      Confrontation Creature. Since it's the first time he has done so
      and the Confrontation Creature has separate HP for each player,
      the Confrontation Creature has all of it's 5 HP when John attacks
      it.

In addition:

-  Confrontation Creatures can't intiate regular attacks on a player or
   be used by a player somehow to launch such an attack unless
   explicitly written on the Confrontation Creature.
-  When aborting a Quest against a Confrontation Creature your opponent
   *may* distribute damage equal to the ATK of the Confrontation
   Creature among any of your creatures that have previousley interacted
   with it by being on combat with it or using their abilities on it.
-  Confrontations can't be *equipped* - you can still only Equip your
   own creatures.
-  When you are the random opponent that gained control of the
   Confrontation Creature you can't mark it in order to use it as
   payment: You're still only able to mark your own creatures in the
   offensive & defensive as payment for other card effects.

Expiration
----------

Quests that have been around for *one full round* (both players had
their own turn) and that have not been activated by any player are
automatically removed from the game. There are two exceptions to this:

#. Confrontations stay no matter how many rounds they haven’t been
   activated in.
#. Only one Quest may be removed per round due to expiration, even if
   both cards have expired. When this scenario arises the player with
   the lowest amount of VP decides which one will be removed. If both
   players have the same amount of VPs then the player with the lowest
   Influence gets to decide. If that is also a tie between the players
   please use a random event that will make the decision.

New Quests
----------

The Quest Decks are normally covered by a face up Quest Card once the
game has begun. Whenever a Quest card has been removed form game, for
whatever reason, the Quest Deck beneath it will be revealed. All new
Quests come from one of the Quest Decks that are revealed in that way.

There are only two ways in which new Quests can be revealed to the
players:

**1. Quest Expiration** When a Quest expires it is removed from the
game. As it is removed from it's Quest deck the Quest deck is revealed.
Turn the top card on that Quest Deck face up. That Quest is now
available to the players.

**2. Quest Completion** If you manage to complete a Quest you *must* do
the following in order to reveal a new Quest:

-  Take the top face down card from the now reveled Quest Deck into your
   hand. View it and then decides if you want that Quest to be available
   or not.

   -  If yes, put it face up at the top of the Quest Deck it was taken
      from.
   -  If no, the card is sent to the bottom of the same Quest Deck it
      was taken from, and the top card of that same Quest Deck is turned
      face up. That Quest is then available to the players.
