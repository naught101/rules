Conflicting Rules & Effects
===========================

As in many card games, some rules & effects in WTactics may seem to
contradict themselves or even do so. *Always* use the following two
rules to resolve such situations.

Cards vs rules
--------------

-  If a card contradicts the core rules found in this document, the card
   wins over the core rules.
-  That cards can change the core rules or supersede them is an
   intentional *feature* in CCG:s. It's what makes this genre
   interesting and modular. Whatever a card says, it will be the case,
   even if the rules forbid it or lack coverage of the topic.

Effects vs effects
------------------

-  If an effects *forbids* something to happen while another allows it,
   the forbidding effect wins.

   -  Example: A creature has the effect "Can not fly." printed on it as
      card text. Playing a spell on the creature with the text "Target
      creature can fly." will not make the creature able to fly. The
      "not/no/can't" etc *always* outweigh what "can/could" happen.
