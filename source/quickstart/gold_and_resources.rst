Gold & Resources
================

Resource Cards
--------------

-  Each card in WTactics can either be played face up, using it's normal
   card text and functionality, or placed in the resource zone face
   down. All cards that are placed in the resource zone face down from
   the players hand become *Resource Cards* that produce gold.
-  A player may only lay down one resource card into his/her resource
   zone per turn, and only during the players own play phase.
-  A resource card produces 1 gold each *turn*, if and only if it
   becomes marked for that purpose.
-  At the end of *turn* all leftover gold that hasn't been used
   disappears: Gold can't be accumulated in between turns.
-  While it's not mandatory to do so we recommend that the player stacks
   his/her resource cards in piles that are built by groups of 4
   resource cards. Resource cards 1 to 4 would be placed in the first
   pile, resource cards 5 to 8 in the second, and resource cards 9 to 12
   in the fourth resource pile. Using piles like that will make it
   easier to keep track of how much gold is available and how much is
   used.

Recycling Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once per turn, during your play phase, you are allowed to pick up
**exactly** four resource cards from your resource zone and place them
into your hand â€” if you have less than four resource cards, you can not
recycle them this way. Cards that you pick up that way are no longer
resource cards and count as any other cards in your hand.

Notice that the rule that regulates the max size of the hand still
applies: If you have more than the allowed hand size you have to discard
cards down to it at the end of turn, during the discard phase.

Card Costs
----------

Normal Gold Costs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  All cards have a gold cost that has to be paid in order for the card
   to be able to enter play.
-  Gold costs are printed with a huge number in the cards top right
   corner, inside of the faction symbol.
-  Whenever it's referred to a *cost(s)* it should be read as "gold
   cost(s)" - there are no other costs in the game! Yet, that does not
   mean that there can't be any additional pre-requisites that has to be
   met for a card to be able to come into play.
-  Usually the cost of a card ranges from 0 to 9.

Variable Gold Costs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cost of X
---------

-  Apart from integers, a card can have a cost of **X**, as well as X
   with a modifier. If that is the case, X is always defined in the card
   text.

   -  Example: A card costs X + 2. It's text says that X is equal to the
      ATK value of the target creature. The target creature's ATK is
      equal to 3, thus we'd have to pay 3 + 2 = 5 gold to play our card.

Cost of T
---------

-  T is also around as a cost, as well as T with a modifier. T is always
   equal the *target cards* gold cost.

   -  Example: A card costs T - 3. The target cards gold cost is 5,
      which means hat we have to pay 5 - 3 = 2 gold to put our card in
      play.

-  T reminds us of X, with the difference that it always takes into
   account one and the same type of variable no matter when or how it is
   played.

Paying a cost
-------------

#. The player looks at the card's gold cost.
#. The player then marks the corresponding amount of unmarked resource
   cards in order to produce that much gold.
#. The card is put into play.
#. The gold has now been spent.
#. Additional cards can be played by repeating the steps above.
