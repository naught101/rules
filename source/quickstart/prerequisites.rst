Prerequisites
=============

In order to play a card one has to be able to pay it's cost and, if any,
meet all the conditions it requires to be true for it to come into play
or it's effect to be activated. The more powerful the card is, the
higher is the cost, and the trickier the prerequisites become.

Sometimes a card has other conditions that have to be met for them to
enter play that go beyond the gold cost and the Loyalty Requirement. In
such cases the prerequisites are printed in written text on the card, as
a part of the card text field. These kinds of prerequisites are often
custom, straight forward and vary highly depending on the card.

**Examples**

-  This card can only be played if you control less creatures than your
   opponent(s).
-  This Equipment can only be attached to a Northener.

If a card can not get any of it's demands met, it can't be played. If it
has got all it's demands met, the player may choose if he/she wants to
play the card or not.
