Round Structure
===============

WTactics is played using individual *player* turns, that are divided
into different game *phases*.

The player who is currently taking his turn is named the active player.
All other players are considered to be *passive* players even if they
would do something (i.e. play Event cards) during the active players
turn. When we refer to "the player" we most often refer to the "active
player". In cases where we don't refer to the active player, we use the
"passive" or "any" player terminology.

Mulligan
--------

-  During each players *first turn* he/she is allowed to do a
   *Mulligan*. The Mulligan can't be performed in a later turn, nor can
   it be performed after a player has accepted the cards that were drawn
   and proceeded within the turn structure.
-  To do a Mulligan the player puts back all 7 cards into the Army Deck,
   re-shuffles the deck, and then draws 7 new cards.
-  The player can then choose to forfeit further chances to do a
   Mulligan, or he/she can perform yet another one.

   -  If the player chooses to do another Mulligan, the player now draws
      x-1 cards, where x is the amount of cards he/she drew the previous
      time.
   -  Again, the player may choose to do yet another Mulligan or stay
      satisfied with the cards he/she has. This process can be repeated
      up to 7 times, in which case the player would be allowed to draw
      1-1 cards, equalling 0.

**Example: Doing two Mulligans** Kim draws 7 cards and then Mulligans
for the first time. Again, Kim draws 7 cards. Kim isn't pleased with
them, so another Mulligan is performed. This time around Kim only gets
to draw 6 cards (7-1).

Tips: You usually don't want to Mulligan more than 2 or 3 times - it
will make you lose momentum and limit your options early in the game,
giving the advantage to your opponent since you crippled yourself.

Turn Structure
--------------

A turn is made up of the following phases, where each name is followed
by the postfix "phase":

#. Unmark/Unassign
#. Upkeep
#. Draw
#. Play
#. Move or Attack
#. Play
#. Move or Attack
#. Entrance
#. Discard

The phases that are *mandatory* are the Unmark/unassign, Upkeep, Draw
and Discard-phases. The Play, Move or Attack and Entrance phases are all
*optional phases* and can all be omitted by you if you choose to do so.
Notice that you can't use a Play or Move/Attack-phase once you have
Played your entrance or Discard-phase: The phases must be played in the
strict order that's specified above.

Turn Phases
~~~~~~~~~~~

Unmark/Unassign
---------------

-  During the unmark and unassign phase a player *must* unmark all
   his/her cards that are marked. This replenishes them for future use
   and is normally a very good thing.
-  In contrast, assigned cards do not automaticllay become unassigned:
   During the unmark/unassign-phase a player *may* unassign target ally
   creatures.

Upkeep
------

-  Sometimes cards require that an *upkeep cost* is paid. This phase is
   only relevant when that kind of cards are around.
-  All such cards have *explicit* text that tell the players if that is
   the case. Such text is written in the form *Upkeep cost ~ What
   happens is the upkeep isn't paid.*

   -  Example: *Upkeep 3 ~ Discard card.* means that the cards upkeep is
      3 gold and that if it isn't paid then the card must be discarded.

-  The player always *chooses* if he/she wants to pay the upkeep or not.

   -  If the upkeep is paid the card continues to be in play as usual
      and it's ~ effect isn't triggered.
   -  Should the player choose not to pay the cards upkeep the text
      after the ~ is triggered.

Draw
----

-  The player *must* draw 1 or up to 2 cards each turn if there are
   cards available in the Army Deck. The player decides him/herself if 1
   or 2 cards are drawn and may look at the first drawn card before
   deciding if another one should be drawn.
-  This applies *even if* the player already has the maximum number of
   allowed cards to his/her playing disposal in hand.
-  If none of the players can draw any cards during the same round due
   to them not having any cards left to draw in their decks the game
   ends at the end of that round. The winner is the one with the most
   Victory Points. In case the players have equal amounts of VP, the
   winner is the one with most Influence.

Play
----

-  The play phases *allows* the player to use creature abilities & play
   any non-creature cards *if* he/she wants to.
-  The inactive player always gets a play phase after each one of the
   active players actions, i.e. to play Event-cards or use abilities.
-  The number of things a player can do during his/her play phase is
   limited only by that player's resources and cards.

   -  Though eventually the player *will* run out of options, as there
      should not exist "infinity-combos" in WTactics.

Move / Attack
-------------

-  This phase is not mandatory - the player chooses if he/she will use
   it.
-  The move/attack phase allows the player to *either* move *or* attack
   with any number of the creatures.
-  It does not allow the player to do both and let one creature move and
   let another attack.
-  Whatever is done in the first move / attack phase *can not* be done
   in the second move / attack phase.

   -  

      -  Each turn there's only one attack phase per player and/or one
         move phase per player.

-  Please see the relevant sections for movement and attacking for more
   details on how to execute those actions properly.

Entrance
--------

During the Entrance phase you may put new Creatures into play in the
Offensive or Defensive.

Discard
-------

-  If the player has *more than* 7 cards in his/her hand the
   player\ *must* select and discard any excess cards down to 7.
-  A player *may not*\ discard cards from hand in the discard phase if
   he/she has 7 or less cards in hand.
