Assigning
=========

|"A" for Assigning...| Aside from a card being in a marked and unmarked
state, it sometimes has the ability to be in an *alternative* mode: The
assigned state. It works in similar ways to marking but also differs in
a couple of important aspects from the marked state, as we'll soon see.

Assigned Creatures can't
------------------------

-  Attack or defend.
-  Mark or un-mark.
-  Be targeted by their controller or ally player, but may still be
   targeted by an opponent.
-  Become automatically unassigned.
-  Use *any* of their non-assigned triggered/cost/permanent abilities:
   While an assigned card keeps its faction belonging, loyalty
   requirement, attack and defense values, card and subtypes, it *loses*
   all of it's abilities except the assigned one while it is in the
   assigned state.

Assigning
---------

-  Only unmarked and unassigned Creatures with the assignation symbol ()
   can be assigned.
-  To assign a card you need to pay it's assignment cost. This cost is
   indicated by the assignment symbol (a circle) followed by a cost for
   the assignment. After the cost there is a colon sign (:) with text
   that reveals what happens while the card is in an assigned state.

   -  The assignation cost can vary and be nothing except for the
      assignation itself, a gold cost, a custom text, marking or some
      kind of combination of these costs/prerequisites.

-  When being assigned the cards must somehow be altered so that they
   *clearly indicate* that they are in the assigned state.

   -  E.g. the cards could be turned *upside down.*. This may be the
      simplest and smoothest way to solve it but it is not something we
      can endorse or recommend due to legal reasons. Hence we *do not*
      encourage you to use this fine solution. The way assignation is
      indicated should be agreed up on by the players before the game
      starts.

-  An assigned card's assignment ability doesn't get activated until
   *the next turn* after the card was assigned. Usually that would be
   the opponents turn directly after the turn where the player assigned
   the creature.

**Hints:**

-  "Assign" symbol is abbreviated as just **(A)** when being typed out
   as plain text.
-  In wiki you can input the Assign symbol inline in any text to create
   a 10x10 px symbol like this by writing **{{A}}**

Unassigning
-----------

-  Only assigned creatures may be unassigned.
-  Unassignment may only occur in the unmark/unassign phase.
-  Put the card in a way which indicates that it is marked and pay one
   gold. The card is now unassigned, but it can not mark or assign again
   during the same turn in which it was unassigned.
