Triumnvirate
~~~~~~~~~~~~

While WTactics is best played with 2 or 4 players there is plenty of fun
to be had with the Triumvirate version of the game. It's a small change
of rules that regulates which one of your two opponents you are allowed
to attack during your turn. This mod is non-competitive, fun and can
have challenging twists, making it perfect for casual play for three.
Here's how to set it up all up:

**Preparation**

-  Bring a normal dice (1d6)
-  Assign each player a number from 1 to 3. Who gets what number is
   irrelevant and you can decide it in some random fashion if you can't
   agree.

**First round**

-  Somebody rolls a dice: A result of 1-3 means that the first player
   will attack the opponent to his/her right once the game begins. 4-6
   means that the player to the left will be attacked instead.
-  Start the game as you would a normal one. Keep in mind who the first
   player is allowed to attack: That person is either located
   *clockwise* or *counter-clockwise*. The rest of the players should
   attack in the same clock-rotation, giving us a setup where every
   player has one'' single'' legit target and that target being
   different from everyone elses.

**All other rounds**

-  Let the next player re-roll the dice. 1-3: You continue in the same
   clockrotation. 4-6: You change rotation, so everyone gets a new
   target instead of the old one.
-  A player is allowed to attack any target player he/she wants to and
   disregard the rotation set by the dice if he/she can afford to

   -  Discard 3 cards in hand, randomly picked by the player he/she
      wants to be able to attack *or*
   -  While no gold has bee spent yet, be able to mark all his/her gold.

Open Mulligan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Each player is only allowed *one single* Mulligan.
-  When performing a Mulligan a player *may* keep up to two cards his
   hand, while re-shuffling the rest of it.

   -  *If* the player does keep one or two cards then the must be shown
      to all other players. The player draws cards until he/she has 7 in
      hand once again, and then keeps them.

-  If the player did not keep one of the cards during the opening draw
   he/she draws 7 new cards as usual. The player may *not* perform
   another mulligan though after that.
