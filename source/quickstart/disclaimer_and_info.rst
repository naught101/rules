-  Lingual edits are allowed by anyone as long as they keep the
   semantics and logic of the game, the intention of a rule and so on,
   fully intact and don't change how the game works.

-  Rule-edits are allowed only after being cleared with snowdrop
   first.

-  These rules are, in their current state, only intended for
   *developers* that work on the same ruleset as snowdrop, which is
   dubbed "the Original Rules Concept", or ORC in short. Their primary
   purpose is to function as a *concept rules* for concept testing done
   by the developers of ORC. This means that it doesn't matter much if a
   wider audience and the public understands them or not as they're
   internal. The concept rules will be turned into playtest rules once
   they are stable enough.
-  The ORC intends to live up to the `General Design
   Document <General Design Document>`__ & the `Local Design Document
   for the ORC <Local design document (ORC)>`__.
-  This document will exist in an additional and more extensive version
   and also in a very short quick-start version once it's been more
   finalized after playtesting. For the time being, all rules that will
   be up for dev. testing are gathered *here* and aforementioned
   documents will be created at a later stage when the rules have
   matured enough.
-  *All* content in here can and will likely change as we continue
   development, concept- & playtesting and revising. Nothing in here
   represents the finalized game nor should it be seen as set in stone.
-  Questions? Please post them in `our
   forum <http://WTactics.org/forum>`__ after asking us for an account
   in there or mail them.
