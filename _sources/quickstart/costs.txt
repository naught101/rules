Costs
=====

Before a card may be put into play, its *cost* must be paid. In WTactics, costs
come in three varieties:

Gold Cost
   Each card has an associated gold cost indicated in the upper right-hand
   corner which indicates how much gold must be spent to be use that cards
   ability.

Loyalty Cost
   Some cards have a loyalty cost which must be paid in addition to the gold
   cost.

Prerequisite Cost
   Occasionally, a card may require that certain other game conditions be
   satisfied before it may be played.
